We know the ideal popping temperature of popcorn kernels to be 180 degrees Celcius. We approximated a popping rate for each kernel as there are expected to be duds. \n",

We will apply our derived change in temperature equation for each individual layer in conjunction with our pop rate to find the total number of unpopped, popped, and burnt kernels over "
